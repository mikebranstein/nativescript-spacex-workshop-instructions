## Introduction

Welcome to the NativeScript Workshop!

To get started you'll need the following pre-requisites:

* Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
* Web browser and access to https://play.nativescript.org
* Android or iOS mobile device with WiFi or Cellular connection

### About NativeScript

[NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) is a framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS. NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine, no WebViews, resulting in native-like performance and UX.

NativeScript provides a best-of-both-worlds development experience. Our cross-platform JavaScript modules give you the convenience of writing iOS and Android apps from a single JavaScript code base, while our runtimes give you the power of accessing native APIs, SDKs, and frameworks when you need them—all without needing to open Xcode or Android Studio. NativeScript was created and is supported by Telerik.

To learn more about how NativeScript works, check out this quick 3-minute video.

### About the NativeScript Playground

The [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org) is a browser-based environment for developing simple NativeScript apps. It’s a great place to get started learning NativeScript, as you can develop apps without needing to install the various SDKs and tools needed for native iOS and Android development. All you need is your browser, and an Android or iOS mobile device connected to the internet to get started. 

In this workshop, we'll be using the NativeScript Playground to quickly prototype an app. It's a powerful tool, and we believe you'll like this approach because you don't need to install anything on your computer to get started.

### What you're building

In this workshop you'll learn how to build iOS and Android mobile apps using NativeScript. Throughout the workshop, you'll be building a [SpaceX](https://spacex.com) Launch Information app that uses the SpaceX launch [API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches). The app will list past and future SpaceX launches, and allow you to learn more about each launch.

### Inspirations

A portion of this workshop was inspired by a [fun weekend project](https://brosteins.com/2016/03/26/nativescript-mobile-app-kids/) Mike built with his son. We're really into building robots right now, so we built a cardboard robot with his tablet as the head. I ended up writing a quick NativeScript soundboard app so the robot could talk back to him.

### Download our Book!

We promise - this is the last plug. We wrote a book about NativeScript. And you can [download it](https://nativescript.org/book). For free. Yes, free. Free, like beer.
